Variables:
A variable is a place to store data. Each variable is given a unique name. Variables in Ruby are able to contain different values and types of data. Variable names in Ruby can be created from alphanumeric characters and the underscore character. A variable cannot begin with a number and variable names can not begin with a capital letter. Variable names should be meaningful. Ruby has four types of variable scope:
    Local ([a-z] or _), 
		Global ($), 
		Instance (@), 
		and Class (@@)
Variables play an important role in programming because they enable programmers to write flexible programs. Rather than entering data directly into a program, one can use variables to represent the data.


Methods:
A method in Ruby is a set of expressions that returns a value. With methods, one can organize their code into subroutines that can be easily invoked from other areas of their program. Before we can use a method, it must first be defined with the word “def”. After the def we give our method a name, and at the end of our method definition, we use the word “end” to denote its completion. Ex: 

```
def say
   method goes here
end
```
			 
Methods are a major part of programming in Ruby. Knowing what a method is and what operations it is performing is crucial in Ruby and are used constantly.
