For our CLI Data Gem project we were required to utilize data from an API and go one level deep, where a user can select a choice and find out more information about their selection. For my project, I chose the Rick and Morty characters. First, I installed Bundled Gem. I then added an executable file into the gem’s bin directory. Here, the file needs a shebang in order to figure out what program to run. I then added files to my rickmorty_cli.rb to set up my project environment. 


To get the data I needed, I parsed the data from API’s base url using JSON to get a list of characters. From there, one selects the character they are interested in learning more information about. Once a character is selected, the user can see their gender, species type, and their status. 


This project was a bit of a challenge for me, especially in the beginning. But with lots of googling and the CLI building videos from our cohort lead, I was able to get a better understanding. There are still some concepts I’d like to understand more but with time and practice I’m sure it will all make much more sense to me.
